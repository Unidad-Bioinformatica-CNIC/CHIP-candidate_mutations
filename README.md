## Build pathed GRCh38 reference genome
The U2AF1 gene is essential for mRNA splicing and is often mutated in cancers such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. However, updates in the GRCh38 human reference genome hinder the detection of these mutations by variant calling pipelines as described in [Failure to Detect Muta,tions in U2AF1 due to Changes in the GRCh38 Reference Sequence](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.10.013).
